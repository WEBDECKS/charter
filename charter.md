# WEBDECKS Charter

This is the Charter for the Web3 and Blockchain Development Exploration, Collaboration, and Knowledge-Sharing (WEBDECKS) Mastermind Group.

## Purpose

The WEBDECKS Mastermind group is a community of individuals interested in exploring and learning about web3 and blockchain development, including, by extension, web development. The group provides a platform for members to connect with like-minded individuals, share their knowledge, and collaborate on projects.

## Goals

The goals of the group are to:

1. Foster a supportive and collaborative community where members can develop their skills, share knowledge, and grow personally and professionally.
1. Encourage exploration and learning of web3 and blockchain development, including, by extension, web development.
1. Provide a platform for members to collaborate on projects, share resources and offer their expertise.
1. Foster a positive and inclusive environment that is respectful of all members.

## Membership

Membership is restricted but conceptually open to anyone who shares an interest in web3 and blockchain development. All members are expected to abide by the group's code of conduct and contribute positively to the community. If a current member wishes to bring someone into the group, we respectfully ask they discuss it with the group in advance. This is to ensure the best experience for all members of the group, as Mastermind groups work best with a controlled number of members.

## Meetings and Meetups

The group is intended initially as an “asynchronous” one. As such, there is no set timetable for meetings, either in-person or virtually, as this will depend on the preferences of the members. We will encourage face-to-face meetups if they are practical and/or are geared around a specific event.

## Communication

The group will maintain open communication channels to facilitate collaboration and discussion between members. This may include a messaging platform, email, or other forms of communication as agreed upon by the members.

## Projects

Members are encouraged to collaborate on projects related to web3 and blockchain development. The group provides a platform for members to share their ideas and resources, and members may form subgroups to work on specific projects.

## Governance

By its nature, the group is a decentralised autonomous organisation. Although there are founding members of the group, the intent is that the group self-organises to achieve its goals best. This charter and the code of conduct will be maintained by the group openly.

## Amendments

This charter may be amended by a proposal to the openly maintained repository. Assuming amendments are clarifications and not a change in the core purpose of the group, it is expected most proposals will be accepted by proxy.

## Agreement

By joining the WEBDECKS Mastermind group, members agree to abide by this charter and contribute positively to the community.
