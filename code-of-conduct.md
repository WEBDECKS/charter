# WEBDECKS Code of Conduct

The WEBDECKS Mastermind group is a community of individuals who share a common interest in exploring, learning and growing together in the web3 and blockchain development space. To create a supportive, collaborative and respectful environment, we ask that all members abide by the following code of conduct:

1. **Be Respectful**: All members of the group are expected to treat each other with respect, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other personal characteristic.
1. **Maintain Confidentiality**: All discussions and information shared within the group must be kept confidential. This includes the identity of members, their ideas, and their projects. Members must obtain explicit permission before sharing any information outside the group. We are on a first-name basis, and not all members publicise their identities.
1. **Be Open-minded**: We encourage members to challenge their assumptions and be open to new ideas and perspectives. We ask that all members be respectful when offering feedback and approach discussions with a willingness to learn and grow.
1. **Be Collaborative**: The Mastermind group is a place for collaboration and teamwork. Members are encouraged to share their skills, knowledge, and resources to help others in the group. Members are also expected to be open to receiving feedback and help from others.
1. **No Egregious Self-Promotion**: The Mastermind group is not a place for self-promotion or marketing. Members are expected to refrain from promoting their products or services or engaging in any other form of self-promotion.
1. **No Discrimination**: Discrimination, harassment, or any form of bullying will not be tolerated. Members who engage in such behaviour will be removed from the group.
1. **Be Polite**: Members are expected to behave politely at all times. This includes being punctual if you arrange a meetup, respecting the time of others, and being responsive to communication from other members.
1. **Maintain Commitment**: Members are expected to contribute to discussions and actively engage with other members. It is only through open discussion that we can test ideas, learn, and grow.

By joining the WEBDECKS Mastermind group, members agree to abide by this code of conduct. Any member who violates this code of conduct may be removed from the group at the discretion of the organisers.
